# Yellow Pages Scraper

## Overview

This Python script is designed to scrape business information from the Yellow Pages website for the greater Melbourne area and export the data into an Excel spreadsheet. The script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and pandas for handling data.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

## Usage

    ```

    ```

The script will fetch business information from the Yellow Pages and save it to an Excel file named business_list.xlsx in the same directory.

## Customization
